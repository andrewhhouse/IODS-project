## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

  
  ### Eplore data 
  
dim(lrn14)
### 183   60
str(lrn14)

# print the "Attitude" column vector of the lrn14 data
lrn14$Attitude

# divide each number in the column vector
lrn14$Attitude / 10

# create column 'attitude' by scaling the column "Attitude"
lrn14$attitude <- lrn14$Attitude / 10

# Access the dplyr library
library(dplyr)

# questions related to deep, surface and strategic learning
deep_questions <- c("D03", "D11", "D19", "D27", "D07", "D14", "D22", "D30","D06",  "D15", "D23", "D31")
surface_questions <- c("SU02","SU10","SU18","SU26", "SU05","SU13","SU21","SU29","SU08","SU16","SU24","SU32")
strategic_questions <- c("ST01","ST09","ST17","ST25","ST04","ST12","ST20","ST28")

# select the columns related to deep learning and create column 'deep' by averaging
deep_columns <- select(lrn14, one_of(deep_questions))
lrn14$deep <- rowMeans(deep_columns)

# select the columns related to surface learning and create column 'surf' by averaging
surface_columns <- select(lrn14, one_of(surface_questions))
lrn14$surf <- rowMeans(surface_columns)

# select the columns related to strategic learning and create column 'stra' by averaging
strategic_columns <- select(lrn14, one_of(strategic_questions))
lrn14$stra <- rowMeans(strategic_columns)



# choose a handful of columns to keep
keep_columns <- c("gender","Age","Attitude", "deep", "stra", "surf", "Points")

# select the 'keep_columns' to create a new dataset
learning2014 <- select(lrn14, one_of(keep_columns))


# change the name of the second column
colnames(learning2014)[2] <- "age"

# change the name of "Points" to "points"
colnames(learning2014)[7] <- "points"

# print out the new column names of the data
colnames(learning2014)


# select male students
male_students <- filter(learning2014, gender == "M")

# select rows where points is greater than zero
learning2014 <- filter(learning2014, points > "0")

dim(learning2014)
str(learning2014)
## Writing CSV
write.csv(learning2014, file = 'learning2014.csv', row.names= F)

## Reading back in csv
read.csv('learning2014.csv')

# see the stucture of the new dataset
str(learning2014)
## Including Plots
library(ggplot2)

# initialize plot with data and aesthetic mapping
p1 <- ggplot(learning2014, aes(x = attitude, y = points, col = gender))

# define the visualization type (points)
p2 <- p1 + geom_point()

# draw the plot
p2

# add a regression line
p3 <- p2 + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# add a main title and draw the plot
p4 <- p3 + ggtitle("Student's attitude versus exam points")
p4
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
